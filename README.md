Introduction what features this app has

Diagram showing stack --> Front end react --> express node js --> mongodb
Explanation of stack and design choice. (Read up on design choices (sheko has sent me something on this i think))

More about the AI --> what its really doing, why its cool and how it can be fine-tuned to be much much better. does it have a place in health care?

Introspection --> things i would change/improve next time, things i learnt. (look at code, look at folder structure)
e.g. looking at how the code is structured, the components could be improved so that some of them are actually reusable.
For example, the input component has a lot of specific functionality to getting drug data.
